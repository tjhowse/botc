# Blood on the Clocktower PDFs

https://bloodontheclocktower.com/

This repo contains the PDFs for the "Blood on the Clocktower" social deduction game.
The repo's goal is to provide a single collection of relevant docs hosted in an
accessible way. I make no guarantees to keep it up-to-date with changes to the official
rules, but I'll try.

Some of the PDFs come from the game developers, some come from [community efforts](http://bignose.whitetree.org/projects/botc/diy/) to
make print-and-play easier. All of the design is by [The Pandemonium Institute](https://www.thepandemoniuminstitute.com/).

I've modelled various parts for 3d printing in the [parts](./parts/) directory. There are various cylindrical tokens,
shrouds, bits boxes and cutters designed to help you cut neat circles of the correct size out of paper and felt.
See this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT7ckgz8vcobaxTT2ZPutclZR1B4fdxIY) for details.

The developers have voiced support for print-and-play, so I'm hoping this repo will not
cause grief.

## Build guide.

### Best option

Wait for the game to come out and order a professionally-made version. This project was fun, but I wouldn't do it again.

### Good option

Print the unofficial token sheets and glue them to a backing material, like thick black card, thin plywood or a suitable plastic. Buy some self-adhesive thin felt and stick that onto the back. Put the whole shebang in a laser cutter and cut everything perfectly in one pass. This may require some alignment jigs, careful selection of plastic, glues and felts, but I feel it would produce an excellent result.

You'd also need a laser cutter.

### The way I did it

#### Felt

I bought a 2m * 1m length of black felt at the craft shop. There were two different felt materials available, made from different substances. I don't remember which one I got, but they both would've probably been fine. I used about half of it.

#### Printing

I had most of the unofficial PDFs and all of the official PDFs printed at Officeworks. This cost me about $35 in printing in total, including the big colour A3 panels for the outside of the box. I had the rulebooks and almanacs bound at officeworks for about $7 each. Generally anything the players would see was printed in colour. Everything else was black and white.

I bought a cheap laminator from officeworks too. I laminated a bunch of stuff. Laminators are fun.

#### Gimoire box

My grimoire box started life as a Pandemic Legacy Season 0 box. I emptied it and used PVA glue to attach the large colour panels to the outside. Ben's grimoire covers have a few variants for the long sides. I went with one paper-effect and one "Blood on the Clocktower" panel for each of the top and bottom halves. I covered the outsides of the boxes with contact adhesive - easily the most annoying part of the job. I cut out some felt to exactly match the big inside face of each half of the box (careful, they're different sizes) and then painted the inside with PVA glue. I stuck the felt down, using a small plastic tube to roll it around to get good adhesion. I lined the inside sides of the box with fairly thin black card. Don't use thick card or felt for the vertical insides as you won't be able to put the box back together again.

I wish I'd spraypainted the inside of the box before starting to glue things in. There is a small gap visible between the felt and the black card. It would've looked better had it all been black.

Print two of the clips to hold the grimoire together during play, or just use dogclips.

#### Tokens

I printed all the tokens in black PLA. Getting the bed nice and level let me print a full bed of tokens at once. Getting my Z height dialled in properly meant I didn't have to trim off the slight flange at the bottom of each token. I also printed each of the cutter devices, except for the night and alignment token cutters, and glued a stanley blade fragment to each. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbR4J_EybyQ&list=PLT7ckgz8vcobaxTT2ZPutclZR1B4fdxIY&index=1) youtube video for details.

I used my printed cutters to cut out all of the circular tokens. I cut out the shroud, night and alignment tokens by hand with a ruler and razor blade, or scissors.

I used [Selley's Kwik Grip Spray Contact Adhesive](https://www.bunnings.com.au/selleys-150g-kwik-grip-spray-contact-adhesive_p1230081) to glue the felt on. I found a stout bit of wood I could clamp to a table and cut out a piece of felt that would fit beneath it. I ignored the directions on the can and sprayed down a fairly thick, three passes, layer of glue onto the felt then immediately laid out all the tokens, leaving at least 2-3mm between them. I wrapped the felt and tokens in greaseproof paper and clamped them together for 12 hours. Don't rush this. It takes ages for this glue to properly dry.

I then cut the felt with a knife to roughly separate the tokens, then went through with a pair of scissors to trim the felt down to size.

I then glued on the paper labels using a thin layer of PVA glue. I worked out how many labels I could fit under my clamping wood and glued the labels on in batches that size.

#### Bits boxes

The bits boxes that come with the proper game are long and thin. Those wouldn't fit on my print bed, so I went with squares versions instead. I made each compartment big enough to hold four stacks of the reminder tokens, so the reminders and character tokens can be stored together. I plan to 2D print labels for the tops of the bits boxes.
